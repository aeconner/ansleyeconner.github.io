<h3>Bear Hybernation</h3>
		 <p>There are many cool facts about bears that most people do not know. When bears are in the cycle of hyperphagia, which is a period of excess eating
       when they are preparing for hibernation, they can consume up to 20,000 calories a day. Hyperphagia occurs from early August to late October, which around 92 days.
       That means that in this period of Hyperphagia bears can eat up to 1,840,000 calories!!!! While bears are in hybernation their metabolism slows down, their body temperature
       decreases slightly, and their heart rate slows from about 55 to 9 beats per minute. Bears can go this entire hibernation period without eating, drinking, or going to the bathroom.
       Females are woken during hybernation because they give birth during this time.

      <h3>Information About Endangered Bears</h3>
		 <p>Today many species of bears are endangered such as the polar bear and the panda bear. Many people have taken a deep interest in protecting bears and keeping them from going extinct.
       An example is the 'Free the Bears Fund', which was started in Austrailia by Mary Hutton. This fund was founded in March of 1995 as a non profit organization. This project has expanded
       to Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Volunteers works to rehabilitate Asian black bears, Sun bears, and Sloth bears who have been rescued.
